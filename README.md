Bubble Popper by PÃ©ter Szladovits & Bella Kocsis - very basic version

If the right number is pressed, the bubble pops, score is added.
After every 10 points, the player levels up, which speeds up the bubbles.
On the 5th level, insade mode gives 5x more points for 1 bubble popped and stops leveling up.
If the bubble reaches the bottom without being popped, player losts 1 life.
If esc pressed or player lost all lives, the game exits.
